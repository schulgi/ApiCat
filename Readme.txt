// Created a solution ApiSolution which is an api project that uses swagger or postman with JWT token, in swagger add in the authorization button "Bearer token" in postman add it in the header of the request.

The apis gets a random cat from the web cataas.com and flips the image, another api is to create or delete users, another api to retrieve a gif from cataas.com.

Theres another solucion ApiCat which uses identity to validate users it has a simple interface with buttons which calls the controller to retrieve the images from the API.
